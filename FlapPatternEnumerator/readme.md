FlapPatternEnumerator
=================

FlapPatternEnumerator (FPE) is aimed to help enthusiastic origami designer
to find a desirable flap for their new origami model by
enumerating all origami flap patterns.


In origami, a flap is composed of several radial creases that all share a terminal.
Origami designers may be curious to find a new, useful flap shape for their creation,
however, such task is  hard for human because it is a sort of combinatorial problem.

FPE finds all flaps which satisfy the necessary and sufficient condition to be flat,
as well as generates all patterns which consist of inputted partial radial patterns.
